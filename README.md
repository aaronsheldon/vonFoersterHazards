# von Foerster Hazards

In this project we implement a model of age dependent communicable diseases using a mysterious and magical alchemy of von Foerster dynamics, Gompertz processes - biologically endogenous ageing modeled by Poisson processes subordinated by integrated geometric Brownian motion, Makeham processes - biologically exogenous casualties of serialized interactions, accelerated failure time models, and phase type distributions, while incanting the theory of stochastic processes and their infinitesimal generators: the all mighty hazard rate.
