# von Foerster Hazards

In this project we implement a model of age dependent communicable diseases using a mysterious and magical alchemy of von Foerster evolution equations, Gompertz ageing processes, accelerated failure time models, and phase type distributions, while stirring virgorously with the theory of stochastic processes and their infinitesimal generators: the all mighty hazard rate.
