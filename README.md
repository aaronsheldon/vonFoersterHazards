von Foerster Hazards
====================

In this project I implement a model of age dependent communicable diseases using a mysterious and magical alchemy of von Foerster dynamics, Gompertz processes - biologically endogenous ageing modeled by Poisson processes subordinated by integrated geometric Brownian motion, Makeham processes - biologically exogenous casualties of serialized interactions, accelerated failure time models, and phase type distributions, while incanting the theory of stochastic processes and their infinitesimal generators: the all mighty hazard rate.

Biography
---------

I am a feral mathematician set loose in the life sciences. I specialize in building precisely calibrated high resolution scientific instruments that integrate, at scale, large, high dimensional, heterogeneous longitudinal administrative and transactional enterprise data sources, to conduct rigorous [observational experiments][01] that [test hypotheses][02] about the processes of entire organizations, systems, and economies, at the level of individual interactions. I have an eclectic background in the sciences, spanning mathematics, physics, computer science, molecular biology, clinical research, epidemiology, and population surveillance. The tools I use are equally eclectic, and project dependent. I have an insignificant publication record, with my first and best [work][03] stemming from the tail end of an unremarkable Bachelors of Science in Mathematics and Physics from [Bishop's University][04]. I hold a similarly undistinguished [Masters of Science in Mathematical Statistics][05] from the [University of Calgary][06]. I am currently employed with [Alberta Health Services][07], where I am working to establish my vision of a public sector that efficiently reallocates resources to equitably redistribute the risks that are within society's control, with a specific mission to elucidate the fundamental mechanics and dynamics of risk. Sometimes I have time to think about topics deeply, but most of the time I can be found herding bits into data sets. The on-line communities I am willing to publicly admit to lurking around are [Github][08], [Tableau Forums][09], [Tableau Public][10], and nearly two decades ago once submitting to [MatLab][11]. I am not an [algorithmist][12].
