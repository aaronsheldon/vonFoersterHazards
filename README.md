von Foerster Hazards
====================

In this project I implement a model of age dependent communicable diseases using a mysterious and magical alchemy of von Foerster dynamics, Gompertz processes - biologically endogenous ageing modeled by Poisson processes subordinated by integrated geometric Brownian motion, Makeham processes - biologically exogenous casualties of serialized interactions, accelerated failure time models, phase type distributions, and the Lie algebra of hazard rates, while incanting the theory of stochastic processes.

Biography
---------

I am a feral mathematician set loose in the life sciences. I specialize in building precisely calibrated high resolution scientific instruments that integrate, at scale, large, high dimensional, heterogeneous longitudinal administrative and transactional enterprise data sources, to conduct rigorous [observational experiments][01] that [test hypotheses][02] about the processes of entire organizations, systems, and economies, at the level of individual interactions. To theoretically ground my experimental work I study the [representations][03] of [stochastic processes][04] in [Lie algebras][05]. I have an eclectic background in the sciences, spanning mathematics, physics, computer science, molecular biology, clinical research, epidemiology, and population surveillance. The tools I use are equally eclectic, and project dependent. I have an insignificant publication record, with my first and best [work][06] stemming from the tail end of an unremarkable Bachelors of Science in Mathematics and Physics from [Bishop's University][07]. I hold a similarly undistinguished [Masters of Science in Mathematical Statistics][08] from the [University of Calgary][09]. I am currently employed with [Alberta Health Services][10], where I am working to establish my vision of a public sector that efficiently reallocates resources to equitably redistribute the risks that are within society's control, with a specific mission to elucidate the fundamental mechanics and dynamics of risk. Sometimes I have time to think about topics deeply, but most of the time I can be found herding bits into data sets. The on-line communities I am willing to publicly admit to lurking around are [Github][11], [Tableau Forums][12], [Tableau Public][13], and nearly two decades ago once submitting to [MatLab][14]. I am not an [algorithmist][15]. I [think like a physicist][16].
