    "The canonical von Foerster relationship connects the [hazard rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio) $h$ of the stopping time statistic $A$ of an age dependent stochastic process:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}\\left[N \\parallel A=a, T=t\\right]=n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "by stipulating that the hazard rate is the infinitesimal generator of the [von Foerster forward evolution operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Foerster_equation) of the expected density of states along the age $a$ and time $t$ diagonal:\n",

    "For a general population the hazard rate is a  matrix of transition rates with fixed column sums $\\vec{1}^\\dagger H = 0$, ensuring local conservation of probability. Given a transition of the density of states statistics vector $\\vec{N}$ from density of state vector $\\vec{m}$ to the state vector $\\vec{n}$ the hazard rate matrix is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{P}\\left[ T = t, \\vec{N} = \\vec{n} \\parallel T \\ge t, \\vec{N} = \\vec{m} \\right] = H\n",

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploiting the observation that the von Foerster operator evolves along the fixed age $a$ and time $t$ diagonal we will discretize the evolution operator on an equal grid scale in age and time $\\Delta a = \\Delta t$ of $1$ day:\n",

    "\n",
    "Even the most concise model of age dependent communicable diseases, in which we only account for a handful of observed states and transitions, still requires $8$ density of states functions to distinguish between all the observed outcomes, particularly the when permuting the absorbing state of mortality by causes and settings:\n",

    "Of the possible transitions only the those from susceptible to infected is a strongly exogenous process, representing the transmission of the communicable disease. The other possible transitions represent endogenous biological processes. Over nearly two centuries endogenous biological processes have been well characterized as following [Gompertz failure processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz-Makeham_law_of_mortality) on average, as a function of age $a$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ageing acceleration parameter $\\alpha$ can be either positive or negative. Heuristically exacerbation processes are positive, while recovery processes are negative. For example, hospitalizations increase exponentially with age, while discharges decrease exponentially with age, that is increasing length of hospital stay. Gompertz processes theoretically arise in the asymptotic limit of infinitesimal stochastic accelerations of time. Accelerated failure time as a model of biological response to environmental stresses has been rigorously validated in high throughput basic science experiments on [Caenorhabditis elegans ](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16550). In turn the experimental validation of accelerated failure times gives a parsimonious model for transient infections. The statistical impact of an illness is to accelerate the stopping time by a factor of $\\gamma \\gt 1$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{P}\\left[ A = \\gamma a \\parallel A \\ge \\gamma a \\right] = h\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These results greatly simplify the construction of communicable disease models because, given a priori estimates of the background parameters, only the single acceleration parameter needs to be estimated, and then applied to the background dynamics as an age multiplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the simplicity of Gompertz processes and accelerated failure time models as phenomenological theories of endogenous biological processes, exogenous biological processes, particularly the logistic growth of social interactions through puberty, demands a much more complex theory. In general the rate of interaction between any two ages is given by a bivariate age-age scattering cross section, that can be spectrally decomposed into a sum of products of univariate uniform normalized Eigen functions:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Eigen functions are dimensionless, the Eigen values $\\lambda$ carry inverse volume units of $\\left(\\text{person} \\times \\text{person} \\times \\text{time}\\right)^{-1}$. From empirical observations the dominant first order summand of the age-age scattering cross section is logistic, and can be interpreted as representing the fraction of the demographic of a particular age that is instantaneously available for social interactions:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the scattering cross section in hand we cannot naively place the term into the canonical epidemiological infection rate to determine the hazard rate because social interactions are highly serialized. Instead we will work through a combinatoric-probabilistic argument to derive the hazard of infection under serialized social interactions. For a single person consider a short period of time $\\delta t$ during which that person interacts with $\\kappa$ people. Provided the infections do not grow during the time of $\\delta t$ the hazard $h$ of infection is roughly constant. Assuming transmission is guaranteed when in social contact with an infected person, the probability of getting infected after time $T \\gt \\delta t$ is then the probability that all $\\kappa$ contacts are not infected $I$ before time $\\delta t$:\n",
