    "*All [epidemiological models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) are [Malthusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_growth_model). Fortunately [Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus) was an optimist. His model postulates that a population will continuously approach [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_stability) with the environment, without [overshoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_%28population%29) or [catastrophic collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_collapse).*\n",

    "The canonical von Foerster relationship states that for a stochastic process on age $a$ and time $t$ the [infinitesimal generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_generator_%28stochastic_processes%29) of probability is the kernel of the evolution of the expectation. Formally, given the [hazard rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio) $h$ of the stopping time statistic $A^{\\left(t\\right)}$ of an age dependent stochastic process:\n",

    "The von Foerster equation reflects the observation that while the state of an individual may change the birth cohort will remained fixed. For a system of occupancy in multiple states the hazard rate is a matrix of transition rates $H$. For endogenous processes the hazard rate matrix must maintain detailed balance within each age $a$ cohort at each time $t$:\n",

    "In either case to ensure the hazard rate matrix $H$ represents a topologically well formed ordering of transitions between states the the diagonal entries must be non-negative and the off diagonal entries must be non-positive. We can immediately observe that for the stopping time statistic $A^{\\left(t\\right)}_{i \\rightarrow j}$ of the first transition from state $i$ to the absorbing state $j$ we have the hazard rate matrix:\n",

Furthermore, because the duration of integration can exceed the smallest [characteristic dwelling time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_%28physics%29) of the states there will be unobserved intermediate transitions between states. As a consequence the kernel of the von Foerster equation is the [adjoint derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_of_the_exponential_map) of the integral of the hazard rate, where the dot is the [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) application of the [adjoint operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_representation) $ad_X Y=XY-YX$ to the parenthesized hazard rate $H$:\n",

    "When the hazard rate matrix is constant the adjoint derivative simplifies to the hazard rate, and the partial differential equation takes on it's usual linear form.

    "Fortunately if the duration of integration is sufficiently short the hazard rate matrix is approximately constant, enabling us to apply a [finite element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) scale of one day in age and time $\\Delta a = \\Delta t = 1 \\enspace\\text{day}$ to evolve the von Foester along the cohort diagonals:\n",

    "To ensure that we can work with the nuances of integer counts without excluding low hazard transitions due to an arbitrary choice in rounding we have to introduce two steps. First, for the fractional part of the count we draw a value $u$ from the uniform probability distribution on $\\left[0,1\\right)$ incrementing by $1$ if the fractional part exceeds the draw $u$ and incrementing by $0$ otherwise. Second, we conserve state occupancy $n_i$ by ordering the transition counts $n_{i \\rightarrow j}$ from largest to smallest cutting off immediately before the cumulative losses exceed the state occupancy $n_i$. Note that the hazard rate matrix convention we will use throughout this work will be for columns to represent SOURCES and rows to represent TARGETS, \"*from column to row*\"."

It measures the average rate that a single person engages in activities that in the presence of an infection would result in transmission. Although the hazard rate is stated in terms of transmission to susceptible members of the population we can exploit the symmetry of the age-age scattering cross section to determine the social contact rate $\\eta$ from the social contact rate of an infectious member of the population. For measles the daily average social contact rate is on the order of one transmissible contact per person day $\\eta \\approx 1 \\enspace\\text{contact} \\times \\left(\\text{person} \\times \\text{day} \\right)^{-1}$. In contrast, a sexually transmitted infection, such as HPV, in communities that engage in a high degree of long term monogamy has a rate that is on the order of one transmissible contact per thousand person days $\\eta \\approx 10^{-3} \\enspace\\text{contacts} \\times \\left(\\text{person} \\times \\text{day} \\right)^{-1}$; being largely driven by the rate at which sexual partners are changed.\n",

    "Simplifications\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In balancing the physical plausibility of the model with the availability of data that provides a priori estimates of background parameters we will make ten approximations to simplify the formulation of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The hazard rate is approximately constant over a single day.\n",
    "* Interactions are serialized, they happen one after another.\n",
    "* People are contagious within the day of infection, and are contagious until fully recovered or discharged. This is justified both by qualitative case studies published in peer reviewed journals, and anecdotal accounts published by journalist.\n",
    "* Hospitalization acts as an effective quarantine.\n",
    "* Mortality due to infection proceeds fast enough that fatalities due to infection are the only immediate absorbing state for both infected and hospitalized. This eliminates the transitions from infected and hospitalized to background fatality due to ageing.\n",
    "* The impact of infection is an equal acceleration to the hospitalization, recovery, discharge, and fatality hazards. Effectively the sicker the patient the slower they recover.\n",
    "* The impact of infection is fully transient, so that fatalities due to ageing among the recovered and discharged proceed at the same rate as those among the susceptible.\n",
    "* The fatality rate of the infected is the same as the fatality rate of the hospitalized, this is the most dubious of all the assumptions and simplifications, as it ignores the strong gatekeeper effects in hospitalization that a priori select for more severely ill patients.\n",
    "* The rate of recovery of the infected is the same as the rate of discharge of the hospitalized. This is primarily because we have well calibrated hospital discharge rates, but lack the equivalent rates for recovery in community.\n",
    "* Infection confers immunity for at least a year following resolution. The jury is still out on this approximation, as the duration of immunity maybe as short as months.\n",

Furthermore, applying spectral decomposition within the Lie algebra of hazard rates the hazard rate can be decomposed into summands of products of univariate endogenous scalar scattering rates that depend only on the age of the cohort $\\hat{\\sigma}$ and exogenous matrix hazard rates $H_\\hat{\\sigma}$ that depends on the population $\\vec{n}$:\n",

The exogenous hazard rate and scattering cross section summand can even incorporate processes of resource saturation, such as finite hospital bed capacity. Begin by recognizing that resources can be in states of allocation, just as individuals can be in states of health. Even further resources evolve along an age $a$ time $t$ cohort diagonal of constant first opening time $a-t$, in effect \"*Resources are people too!*\". This leads to an auxiliary model of transitions between states of allocation of a finite resource that augments the minimal model of age dependent communicable disease. The simplest model has a resource cycling through three states of allocation from available $n_\\text{RA}$ to occupied $n_\\text{RO}$ to refractory $n_\\text{RR}$ and back to available, with an annihilation state of closed $n_\\text{RC}$, representing permanent loss of the resource, the auxiliary augmentation is:\n",

Rounding off to $25\\%$ we have the interpretation that while infected a $30$ year old faces the same mortality risk as a healthy $45$ year old, and more gravely an infected $80$ year old faces the same mortality risk as a healthy $120$ year old. This leads to a concise heuristic interpretation of the social burden of the infection. It is not that it causes preventable deaths it is that it causes all the deaths that would have occurred over the next three years to occur in the next three months."
