Formally, given the [hazard rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio) $h$ of the stopping time statistic $A$ of an age dependent stochastic process:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}\\left[N \\parallel A=a, T=t\\right]=n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the hazard rate $h$ is the kernel of the [von Foerster forward evolution operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Foerster_equation) acting on the expected density of states $n$ along the age $a$ and time $t$ diagonal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\partial_a n + \\partial_t n = - h \\cdot n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a general population the hazard rate is a  matrix of transition rates with fixed column sums $\\vec{1}^\\dagger H = 0$, ensuring local conservation of probability. Given a transition of the density of states statistics vector $\\vec{N}$ from density of state vector $\\vec{m}$ to the state vector $\\vec{n}$ the hazard rate matrix is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{P}\\left[ T = t, \\vec{N} = \\vec{n} \\parallel T \\ge t, \\vec{N} = \\vec{m} \\right] = H\n",
    "$$\n",

    "In turn the, possibly inhomogeneous, hazard rate matrix determines the evolution of the density of states vector field:\n",

    "We will use the preceding density of states vector equation to phenomenologically model the age dependent dynamics of communicable diseases, subject to the boundary conditions of an initial demographic $\\vec{n}(a,0)$, and constant birth rate $\\vec{n}(0,t)=\\vec{n}_\\text{B}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are working with a continuous density of states $\\hat{n}$ we can exploit the observation that the von Foerster operator evolves along the fixed age $a$ and time $t$ diagonal to discretize the evolution operator on an equal grid scale of one day in age and time $\\Delta a = \\Delta t = 1 \\text{ day}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{n}\\left(a + \\Delta t, t + \\Delta t \\right) = \\vec{n}\\left(a, t\\right) - H \\vec{n}\\left(a, t\\right) \\cdot \\Delta t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However if we wish to capture the subtly of integer occupancy in the density of states $\\hat{n}$ then we need to use explicit transition probabilities. Assuming that for a single person only one transition occurs in a single day $\\Delta a = \\Delta t = 1 \\text{day}$ then we can count the number of transitions between states $i \\ne j$, with the approximation that the integral of the hazard is linear in time, which is true if the hazard is roughly constant over a single day:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "    n_{i \\rightarrow j} & = & n_i \\mathbb{P}\\left[ T_{i \\rightarrow j} \\le \\Delta t \\right]\\\\\n",
    "                        & = & n_i \\frac{h_{i \\rightarrow j}}{h_{i \\rightarrow i}}e^{-h_{i \\rightarrow i} \\Delta t}\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the count is less than one $n_{i \\rightarrow j} \\lt 1$, we then draw a value $u$ from the uniform probability distribution on $\\left[0,1\\right)$ assigning $n_{i \\rightarrow j} = 1$ if $n_{i \\rightarrow j} \\ge u$ and $n_{i \\rightarrow i} = 0$ otherwise. This last step ensures that we can work with the nuances of integer counts without excluding low hazard transitions due to an arbitrary choice in rounding. To ensure conservation of state occupancy $n_i$ we order the transition counts $n_{i \\rightarrow j}$ from largest to smallest and cutoff immediately before the cumulative losses exceed the state occupancy $n_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the most concise model of age dependent communicable diseases, in which we only account for a handful of observed states and transitions, still requires $8$ density of states functions to distinguish between all the observed outcomes, particularly when permuting the absorbing state of fatality by causes and settings:\n",

    "Of the possible transitions only the those from susceptible to infected is a strongly exogenous process, representing the transmission of the communicable disease. The other possible transitions represent endogenous biological processes. Over nearly two centuries endogenous biological processes have been well characterized as following [Gompertz failure processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz-Makeham_law_of_mortality) on average, as a function of age $a$:\n",

    "The ageing acceleration parameter $\\alpha$ can be either positive or negative. Heuristically exacerbation processes are positive, while recovery processes are negative. For example, hospitalizations increase exponentially with age, while discharges decrease exponentially with age, that is increasing length of hospital stay. Gompertz processes theoretically arise in the asymptotic limit of infinitesimal stochastic accelerations of time. Accelerated failure time as a model of biological response to environmental stresses has been rigorously validated in high throughput basic science experiments on [Caenorhabditis elegans ](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16550).

    "\n",
    "In contrast to the simplicity of Gompertz processes and accelerated failure time models as phenomenological theories of endogenous biological processes, exogenous biological processes, particularly the logistic growth of social interactions through puberty, demands a much more complex theory. In general the rate of interaction between any two ages is given by a bivariate age-age scattering cross section, that can be spectrally decomposed into a sum of products of univariate uniform normalized Eigen functions:\n",

From empirical observations the dominant first order summand of the age-age scattering cross section is logistic, and can be interpreted as representing the fraction of the demographic of a particular age that is instantaneously available for social interactions:\n",

Instead we will work through a combinatoric-probabilistic argument to derive the hazard of infection under serialized social interactions. For a single person consider a short period of time $\\delta t$ during which that person interacts with $\\kappa$ people. Provided the infections do not grow during the time of $\\delta t$ the hazard $h$ of infection is roughly constant. Assuming transmission is guaranteed when in social contact with an infected person, the probability of getting infected after time $T \\gt \\delta t$ is then the probability that all $\\kappa$ contacts are not infected $I$ before time $\\delta t$:\n",

    "* The impact of infection is fully transient, so that fatalities due to ageing among the recovered and discharge proceed at the same rate as those among the susceptible.\n",
    "* The fatality rate of the infected is the same as the fatality rate of the hospitalized, this is the most dubious of all the assumptions and simplifications, as it ignores the strong gatekeeper effects in hospitalization that a priori select for more severely ill patients.\n",
